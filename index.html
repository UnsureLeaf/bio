               <p> This person has been a big part of my life for 5 years, and although things recently have been shaky, I still admire them and put them on a pedestal in my mind. They've always been there just to be there, and I need to be there for them more often. I care about them with all of my being, as they are such a great person who I've been blessed with knowing.

               They sure have been a big part of influencing the specific type of person I am today, as they have been around for so long. They have been the one to introduce me to many people, and show me a different view on the world as well. I trust and believe in this person with every ounce of my being, and there isn't a person I could care about more. I'm repeating myself at this point, but for sure everything on this list has to be said and emphasized more than once, that's how impactful this person is to my life. After a person has been around for five years, you've also been sure to have shared a lot of experiences together, and this person isn't an exception to that. </p>

              <p> A little bit about them, first of all. They're really into  Neon Genesis Evangelion, Life is Strange, and Danganronpa. They're also very peopular with the people who are involved in communities surrounding those interests. Some experiences we have shared mostly happen during the parties I hold yearly between friends, and they're some interesting ones. There's no need to go into detail about it, but a lot of the stories make me laugh and feel better upon thinking about them. That's just about the effect this person has on people in general. They bring a smile to the faces around them, and always liven up the mood when they're around and happy.

               <br>

              As a person, their morals are pretty people friendly compared to others in this day and age, so they always take a second to help people out that they see in trouble. As much as I say, I still can't bring the idea of this person justice, as they deserve much more than just nice things I can say about them. They deserve the world, and even if they can't get all that, it definitely means a lot to know they can be happy with what they have. That's about as much as I can say about them, especially when this is for class, so that's about it for this website. </p>
